This repo contains the project - Face recognition system for attendance in online classes

The motive of this project is to mark attendence of students in an excel or csv file using face recognition model. At login portal, student should fill his name and mobile number, and webcam will capture his image. If all the credentials match, he will be marked present in the file. There will also be an option to register for new users.

Current progress-
Python model for face recognition is working without any errors.
Front end part of the portal is completed. We are able to capture the image of student through webcam.

Remaining part-
We are currently not able to store the captured image and other credentials and hence python model has not been integrated with the portal.
